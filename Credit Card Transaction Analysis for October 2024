1. Select the transactions involving food only (Note: Costco falls under the 'Shopping' category)

SELECT trans_date, 
       SUBSTR(Description, 1, 30) AS Description, 
       Amount, 
       Category
FROM trans
WHERE Category IN ('Restaurants', 'Supermarkets', 'Food & Drink', 'Shopping')
  AND (
    (Category = 'Shopping' AND description LIKE '%COSTCO%') 
    OR (Category != 'Shopping')
  )
  AND trans_date >= '10/01/2024' 
  AND trans_date <= '10/31/2024'
ORDER BY trans_date DESC;

Note: I didn't want to keep having to include Costco with that complicated query for anything food related so I altered the category from Shopping to Supermarkets 

UPDATE trans
SET Category = 'Supermarkets'
WHERE Category = 'Shopping'
  AND Description LIKE '%COSTCO%';


2. Find the total amount spent on food

SELECT SUM(amount) as Total_Food_Spending
FROM trans
WHERE Category IN ('Restaurants', 'Supermarkets', 'Food & Drink')
AND trans_date >= '10/01/2024' 
AND trans_date <= '10/31/2024';

Total_Food_Spending           
------------------------------
726.53                       


3. List the total amount spent for each category involving food.

SELECT category, SUM(amount) as amount 
FROM trans
WHERE category IN ('Restaurants', 'Supermarkets', 'Food & Drink')
AND trans_date >= '10/01/2024'
AND trans_date <= '10/31/2024'
GROUP BY category;

category                        amount                        
------------------------------  ------------------------------
Food & Drink                    150.86                        
Restaurants                     244.31                        
Supermarkets                    331.36           



4. List the transactions at Mcdonalds including the date, description, and amount spent

SELECT trans_date, SUBSTR(description, 1, 30) as description, amount
FROM trans
WHERE description LIKE '%MCDONALD%'
AND trans_date >= '10/01/2024'  AND trans_date <= '10/31/2024';

trans_date                      description                     amount                        
------------------------------  ------------------------------  ------------------------------
10/02/2024                      MCDONALD'S F18544 TEMPE AZ      9.61                          
10/05/2024                      MCDONALD'S F ADLO TEMPE AZ      9.72                          
10/06/2024                      MCDONALD'S F25112 GLENDALE AZA  14.88                         
10/24/2024                      MCDONALD'S F ADLO TEMPE AZ      10.81                         
10/25/2024                      MCDONALD'S F ADLO               1.39    




5. List the total amount spent at the cafeteria in Amazon's office using the string '365' (This is how much I spend on snakcks during work. Shows the cost of being lazy since I didn't want to pack a lunch)

SELECT SUM(amount) as total_amount 
FROM trans
WHERE description LIKE '%365%' 
AND trans_date >= '10/01/2024'  AND trans_date <= '10/31/2024';

total_amount                  
------------------------------
42.33                         





6. List the transactions when Gas was purchased including the date, category, and amount spent

SELECT trans_date, category, amount 
FROM trans
WHERE category IN ('Gas', 'Gasoline')
AND trans_date >= '10/01/2024'  AND trans_date <= '10/31/2024';

trans_date            category              amount              
--------------------  --------------------  --------------------
10/05/2024            Gasoline              41.94               
10/27/2024            Gasoline              5.79                
10/29/2024            Gas                   26.96               
10/27/2024            Gas                   19.1                
10/17/2024            Gas                   35.8     

Note: Decided to just combine the categories Gas and Gasoline to make queries easier 

UPDATE trans
SET Category = 'Gas'
WHERE Category = 'Gasoline'
  




7. Analyze how much is spent in each category during October 2024

SELECT Category, SUM(Amount) AS Total_Spent
FROM trans
WHERE trans_date >= '10/01/2024' AND trans_date <= '10/31/2024'
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Total_Spent DESC;



8. Identify any purchases that were over $50.

SELECT trans_date, Description, Amount
FROM trans
WHERE trans_date >= '10/01/2024' AND trans_date <= '10/31/2024'
AND Amount > 50;



The End

This was just a basic overview of my spending habits for the month of Oct. 2024. 
I mainly wanted to practice my SQL skills but still thought it'd be interesting to see how I was spending my monthly income. 
Next, I will be doing a more in-depth look of my spending habits across a longer timeframe.
